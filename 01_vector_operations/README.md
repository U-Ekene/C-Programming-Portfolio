## Vector Operations (C)

This program implements common vector operations using float arrays and pointer arithmetic.
It demonstrates how mathematical vector concepts can be implemented in C without external libraries.

### Features
- Vector magnitude calculation
- Unit vector computation
- Vector addition and scaling
- Dot product
- Vector projection

### Concepts Used
- Functions and function decomposition
- Arrays and pointer arithmetic
- Loops
- Basic linear algebra
- Standard C libraries (stdio.h, math.h)

### Notes
- Vectors are fixed-size and hardcoded for demonstration purposes.
- Designed as a learning-focused implementation rather than a full math library.
