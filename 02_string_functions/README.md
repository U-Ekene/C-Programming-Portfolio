## 🔤 String Functions (CLI)

A command-line C program that performs several string-processing tasks on an input string,
implemented using pointer traversal and manual character comparisons (no string.h helpers).

### ✨ Features
- Convert to uppercase and lowercase
- Count vowels (including Y/y)
- Count occurrences of a user-specified character
- Substring search (TRUE/FALSE)
- Delimiter-based tokenization (prints tokens on new lines)
- “Delete” a substring by replacing matches with spaces
- Flow check across spaces (last char of word == first char of next word, case-insensitive)

### 🧠 Concepts Used
- argc / argv command-line input
- Pointer arithmetic with C strings
- Manual substring matching
- ASCII-based case conversion
