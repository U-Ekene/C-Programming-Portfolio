# 🧠 C Programming Portfolio

This repository is a curated collection of standalone C programs developed to
demonstrate progressive understanding of core C programming concepts.
Each program is self-contained, well-documented, and organized for clarity
and ease of navigation.

The focus of this repository is correctness, memory safety, and clear structure
rather than unnecessary abstraction.

## 🗂️ Repository Structure

Programs are organized into numbered folders to reflect increasing complexity:

Each program directory typically contains:
- One or more '.c' source files
- A main.c file used as a test harness
- A Makefile when multiple files are involved
- A README.md describing the program and its features
