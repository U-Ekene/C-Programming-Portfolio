# Recursion Intro

This program contains a collection of small algorithms designed to introduce
and reinforce recursive problem-solving in C. A single `main` function is used
as a test harness to demonstrate each algorithm.

✨ Features
- Recursive detection of adjacent letters in a string (case-insensitive)
- Recursive compression of a 2D integer array into a 1D result
- Recursive implementation of insertion sort (ascending and descending)
- Simple test cases demonstrating expected behavior

🧠 Concepts Used
- Recursion with clear base and recursive cases
- Pointer arithmetic and string traversal
- Dynamic memory allocation and ownership
- 2D arrays represented as pointer-to-pointer structures
- Sorting algorithms and in-place mutation
- Separation of logic and testing via helper functions

📝 Notes
- The adjacentLetters function returns a pointer into the original string,
  not a newly allocated copy.
